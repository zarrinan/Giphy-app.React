### :sunny: Cheer App!

Let's build a react giphy app!

First things first: **Find a buddy!**

#### Your task is:
* Go to the Giphy docs [HERE](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/), _read_ them,  create an account abd get your Free API key.

* Diagram your App:
  * What components will you have?
  * Where would state "live"?
  * Where do you need to pass props?
  * In which lifecycle  method do you need to make your API call?


#### ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

* You have a colorful diagram of your components.
* You have an application that renders a button on page load.
* When a user clicks the button, a random Gif appears on the screen.


#### Done? You are awesome! Here is your :cookie:
